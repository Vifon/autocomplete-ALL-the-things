=head1 NAME

autocomplete-ALL-the-things - an urxvt plugin allowing user to easily complete words

=head1 INSTALLATION

Copy the F<autocomplete-ALL-the-things> file to the urxvt perl-lib directory (default: F<~/.urxvt/ext/>).

Add the following lines to your F<~/.Xresources> (or F<~/.Xdefaults>):

  URxvt.perl-ext-common: ...,autocomplete-ALL-the-things
  URxvt.keysym.M-C-slash:   perl:aAtt:complete
  URxvt.keysym.M-question:  perl:aAtt:skeleton-complete
  URxvt.keysym.M-quotedbl:  perl:aAtt:undo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Completes the currently typed word using the other words visible in the urxvt window.

For example the terminal looks like this:

  foo bar baz
  >> _

I type 'f':

  foo bar baz
  >> f_

Now I can use autocomplete-ALL-the-things to expand the 'f' to 'foo'.

  foo bar baz
  >> foo_

If I had typed 'b', it would be expanded to 'baz' and not 'bar' as the rightmost match is used.

It was strongly inspired by I<dabbrev> feature in GNU Emacs and later by
L<skeleton-complete|https://github.com/baohaojun/skeleton-complete> by Bao
Haojun.

=head1 USAGE

Just press the key bound to I<perl:aAtt:complete> (in the example above:
Alt-Ctrl-slash) to complete the word at point. Subsequent uses cycle through
other possible completions.

Key bound to I<perl:aAtt:undo> (Alt-Shift-quote) undoes the completion.

For more advanced completions use I<perl:aAtt:skeleton-complete>
(Alt-Shift-slash). It's behavior is inspired by I<skeleton-complete>, please see
L<its readme|http://baohaojun.github.io/skeleton-complete.html#sec-2-3> for an
explanation.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Thanks to Bao Haojun for the great idea of L<skeleton-complete|https://github.com/baohaojun/skeleton-complete>.
